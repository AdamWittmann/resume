                <h2>Programming and Software Development</h2>
                <p>I enjoy exploring various coding languages and working on my
                    software projects. In my Software Developement class we are
                    developing an untraditional dating app allowing users to have
                    laughably specific criteria for their matches.

                <h2>Athletics</h2>
                <p>I am actively involved in rowing. Rowing has been a significant part of my life, and recently I've
                    taken up cycling as a new challenge. Sports have taught me discipline, teamwork, the importance of
                    surrounding yourself with good people,
                    and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.</p>

                <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>AI technology facinates me, especially with the application in finance to determine market trends.
                    I'm also intrigued with motion & heart rate tracking and the possibility of AI personal training.

                <h2>Greek Life</h2>
                <p>Being a brother at Theta Delta Chi fraternity has been a significant part of my college experience.
                    It provides me with opportunities for leadership, and meaningful community service. Notably with
                    Peach Hill Park.
