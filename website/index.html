            <h1>Hello, World.</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Wittmann, I am a computer science major, and rower at Marist College. I am currently
                entering my sophomore year. I am actively seeking an internship for the summer of 2025, eager to learn
                new coding languages and enhance
                my skills. I'm studying CS with a focus in software development, but I hope to explore the field of AI.
