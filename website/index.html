            <h1>Hello, World.</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Wittmann, I am a rower, and computer science major at Marist College. I am currently
                entering my sophomore year. I am
                actively seeking an internship for the upcoming summer, eager to learn new coding languages and enhance
                my
                skills. I'm studying CS with a focus in software development, but I hope to explore the field of AI.

            <h3>Landscaping</h3>
            <p>April 2023 - Present</p>
            <p>For the past two summers, a friend and I have independently landscaped homes in our town. My
                responsibilities included managerial tasks, overseeing our team, and ensuring the quality of our work.
                This experience taught me valuable lessons in self-discipline, communication, and teamwork.

            <b>Canisius High School '23</b>

            <p>I graduated from Canisius High School in 2023, consistently maintaining high honors throughout the
                majority
                of my time. My interest in programming began before high school when I took a summer course on coding
                robots. During high school, I took classes such as AP Computer Science and Cybersecurity, where I
                developed
                a passion for coding. I started with C++, moved on to Python, and now work with Java while beginning to
                learn HTML and CSS.</p>
